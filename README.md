# TeamColombia-FGC2023
We, the programming members of Team Colombia participating in the FIRST Global Challenge 2023 in Singapore, have created this GitHub project. 
Its purpose is to serve as a repository for all our codes and algorithms, ensuring easy access to them in the future.
Additionally, we welcome the input and ideas from the entire FIRST Global community, as your contributions can greatly enhance our project.
Please feel free to contribute to this repository with any code snippets, algorithms, or suggestions that you believe may be beneficial to our team. 
Together, we can collaborate and make our project even better. 
Thank you for your support and involvement in our journey towards success in the FIRST Global Challenge 2023.
